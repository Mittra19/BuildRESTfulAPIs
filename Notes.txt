RESTful API:
A RESTful API is a process to do transactions with the backend using HTTP protocol. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods are used. From the frontend, a client uses these HTTP methods to interact with the endpoints created on the backend.
GET - gets the data
POST - adds new data
PUT - updates data
DELETE - deletes data

Bodyparser helps parse JSON http request into our server.

Process:
1. Install the required packages using npm
2. Change the scripts in package.json from "test" to "start". And in the value copy "nodemon ./index.js --exec babel-node -e js".
3. Fill the index.js file with the required code.
4. Create a file called .babelrc. This file tells babel while transpiling, what are the presets we are using. 

5. npm start to run our server.
